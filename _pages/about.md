My name is Mateusz and I would describe myself as a passionate DevOps Engineer trying to automate as much as possible. Usually, true was the sentence of "when I’m not writing the code helping devs in their work, I write more code to help myself do the first thing better".

Currently, I'm working as a DevOps Engineer at Egnyte in the office based in Poznan, Poland.

In my previous work places, I’ve had an opportunity to work within international projects and with this chances came a great possibility to gather useful skills I can use in may day-to-day work. All of the challenges I had to face made me a better DevOps Engineer, but I'm still surfing on my self-development wave.

I’m in love with Kubernetes and I really like Apple's ecosystem.

On a private side, I'm into cars, especially the ones we can meet on the road. I feel strange satisfaction when I can recognize the car only with the sound of its exhaust. Also I am crazy about postapocalyptic books - this started when first game from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series was launched and I felt in love with the universum.
