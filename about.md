My name is Mateusz Kubaczyk. I currently live in Poznan, Poland and I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer trying to automate as much as possible. When I'm not writing scripts helping devs in their work, I write more scripts to help myself do the first thing better. 

I've had, and still have, an opportunity to design, create, maintain and improve infrastructures for the international clients from the whole globe. With this chance comes a great possibility to gather useful skills I can use in may day-to-day work.

I help everyone create efficient infrastructutres that are both fault-tolerant and immune to daily basis threats. Starting from simple restaurant webpage or small Slack bot, going through popular mobile games producer shop, finally getting to demanding resource scheduling and time tracking tool firms around the world use for the project management.

All the challenges I had to face with made me a better planer for future, incoming projects. I can not only predict potential problems, but with such occurences in the past, I worked out a productive manner of solving them. 

I'm definitely in love with AWS, broadly defined Cloud solutions, automation and Apple products.
