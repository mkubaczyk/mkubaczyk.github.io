My name is Mateusz Kubaczyk. I currently live in Poznan, Poland and I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer trying to automate as much as possible. When I'm not writing scripts helping devs in their work, I write more scripts to help myself do the first thing better. 

I've had an opportunity to design, create, maintain and improve infrastructures for international clients from 4 continents. With this chance comes a great possibility to gather useful skills I can use in may day-to-day work.

I help create efficient infrastructures that are both fault-tolerant and immune to daily risks. Starting from a simple restaurant webpage or a small Slack bot, through popular mobile games marketplace, to an advanced resource scheduling and time tracking SaaS tool used by companies from all over the globe.

All of the challenges I had to face made me a better at planning the future, incoming projects. I can not only predict potential problems, but with similar occurrences in the past, Iâ€™ve been able to work out a productive manner of solving them. 

I'm definitely in love with AWS, broadly defined Cloud solutions, automation and Apple products.
