My name's Mateusz Kubaczyk. I currently live in Poznan, Poland and I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer trying to automate as much as possible. When I'm not writing scripts helping devs in their work, I write more scripts to help myself do the first thing better. I'm definitely in love with AWS, broadly defined Cloud solutions, automation and Apple products.
